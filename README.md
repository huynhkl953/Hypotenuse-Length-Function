# Hypotenuse-Length-Function
The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two side: c^2=a^2+b^2. Write a function that, given the lengths of two sides of the triangle, calculates the length of the third side.
